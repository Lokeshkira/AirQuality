## Project Objectives

- Measure air quality parameters (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO2, VOCs) using IoT devices.
- Provide real-time air quality information to the public.
- Raise awareness about the impact of air quality on public health.
- Promote environmental responsibility and informed decision-making.

## System Architecture

- IoT devices collect air quality data.
- Data is processed in real-time using Python.
- Processed data is stored in a database.
- A web-based data-sharing platform displays real-time air quality information to the public.
